Management for BES Cyber System Information that collectively include each of the applicable requirement parts in CIP-
004-8 Table R6 – Access Management for BES Cyber System Information. To be considered access to BCSI in the context of
this requirement, an individual has both the ability to obtain and use BCSI. Provisioned access is to be considered the result
of the specific actions taken to provide an individual(s) the means to access BCSI (e.g., may include physical keys or access
cards, user accounts and associated rights and privileges, encryption keys). [Violation Risk Factor: Medium] [Time Horizon:

C. Compliance
1. Compliance Monitoring Process:
1.1. Compliance Enforcement Authority: “Compliance Enforcement Authority” (CEA)
means NERC or the Regional Entity, or any entity as otherwise designated by an
Applicable Governmental Authority, in their respective roles of monitoring
and/or enforcing compliance with mandatory and enforceable Reliability
Standards in their respective jurisdictions.
1.2. Evidence Retention: The following evidence retention periods identify the
period of time an entity is required to retain specific evidence to demonstrate
compliance. For instances where the evidence retention period specified below
is shorter than the time since the last audit, the CEA may ask an entity to provide
other evidence to show that it was compliant for the full time period since the
last audit.
The applicable entity shall keep data or evidence to show compliance as
identified below unless directed by its CEA to retain specific evidence for a
longer period of time as part of an investigation:
• The applicable entity shall retain evidence of each requirement in this
standard for three calendar years.
• The applicable entity is found non-compliant, it shall keep information
related to the non-compliance until mitigation is complete and approved or
for the time specified above, whichever is longer.
• The CEA shall keep the last audit records and all requested and submitted
subsequent audit records.
1.3. Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement Program: As defined in the NERC
Rules of Procedure, “Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement Program” refers
to the identification of the processes that will be used to evaluate data or
information for the purpose of assessing performance or outcomes with the
associated Reliability Standard.
