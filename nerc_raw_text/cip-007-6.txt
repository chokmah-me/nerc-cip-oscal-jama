CIP-007-6 — Cyber Security – Systems Security Management
4.2.3.5 Responsible Entities that identify that they have no BES Cyber Systems
categorized as high impact or medium impact according to the CIP-002-5.1
identification and categorization processes.
5. Effective Dates:
See Implementation Plan for CIP-007-6.
6. Background:
Standard CIP-007 exists as part of a suite of CIP Standards related to cyber security,
which requires the initial identification and categorization of BES Cyber Systems and
require a minimum level of organizational, operational and procedural controls to
mitigate risk to BES Cyber Systems.
Most requirements open with, “Each Responsible Entity shall implement one or more
documented [processes, plan, etc.] that include the applicable items in [Table
Reference].” The referenced table requires the applicable items in the procedures for
the requirement’s common subject matter.
The term documented processes refers to a set of required instructions specific to the
Responsible Entity and to achieve a specific outcome. This term does not imply any
particular naming or approval structure beyond what is stated in the requirements.
An entity should include as much as it believes necessary in its documented processes,
but it must address the applicable requirements in the table.
The terms program and plan are sometimes used in place of documented processes
where it makes sense and is commonly understood. For example, documented
processes describing a response are typically referred to as plans (i.e., incident
response plans and recovery plans). Likewise, a security plan can describe an
approach involving multiple procedures to address a broad subject matter.
Similarly, the term program may refer to the organization’s overall implementation of
its policies, plans and procedures involving a subject matter. Examples in the
standards include the personnel risk assessment program and the personnel training
program. The full implementation of the CIP Cyber Security Standards could also be
referred to as a program. However, the terms program and plan do not imply any
additional requirements beyond what is stated in the standards.
Responsible Entities can implement common controls that meet requirements for
multiple high and medium impact BES Cyber Systems. For example, a single training
program could meet the requirements for training personnel across multiple BES
Cyber Systems.
Measures for the initial requirement are simply the documented processes
themselves. Measures in the table rows provide examples of evidence to show
documentation and implementation of applicable items in the documented processes.
These measures serve to provide guidance to entities in acceptable records of
compliance and should not be viewed as an all-inclusive list.
Page 3 of 51
CIP-007-6 — Cyber Security – Systems Security Management
Throughout the standards, unless otherwise stated, bulleted items in the
requirements and measures are items that are linked with an “or,” and numbered
items are items that are linked with an “and.”
Many references in the Applicability section use a threshold of 300 MW for UFLS and
UVLS. This particular threshold of 300 MW for UVLS and UFLS was provided in Version
1 of the CIP Cyber Security Standards. The threshold remains at 300 MW since it is
specifically addressing UVLS and UFLS, which are last ditch efforts to save the BES. A
review of UFLS tolerances defined within regional reliability standards for UFLS
program requirements to date indicates that the historical value of 300 MW
represents an adequate and reasonable threshold value for allowable UFLS
operational tolerances.
“Applicable Systems” Columns in Tables:
Each table has an “Applicable Systems” column to further define the scope of systems
to which a specific requirement row applies. The CSO706 SDT adapted this concept
from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Risk Management
Framework as a way of applying requirements more appropriately based on impact
and connectivity characteristics. The following conventions are used in the
“Applicable Systems” column as described.
 High Impact BES Cyber Systems – Applies to BES Cyber Systems categorized as
high impact according to the CIP-002-5.1 identification and categorization
processes.
 Medium Impact BES Cyber Systems – Applies to BES Cyber Systems categorized as
medium impact according to the CIP-002-5.1 identification and categorization
processes.
 Medium Impact BES Cyber Systems at Control Centers – Only applies to medium
impact BES Cyber Systems located at a Control Center.
 Medium Impact BES Cyber Systems with External Routable Connectivity – Only
applies to medium impact BES Cyber Systems with External Routable Connectivity.
This also excludes Cyber Assets in the BES Cyber System that cannot be directly
accessed through External Routable Connectivity.
 Electronic Access Control or Monitoring Systems (EACMS) – Applies to each
Electronic Access Control or Monitoring System associated with a referenced high
impact BES Cyber System or medium impact BES Cyber System in the applicability
column. Examples may include, but are not limited to, firewalls, authentication
servers, and log monitoring and alerting systems.
 Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) – Applies to each Physical Access Control
System associated with a referenced high impact BES Cyber System or medium
impact BES Cyber System.
Page 4 of 51
CIP-007-6 — Cyber Security – Systems Security Management
 Protected Cyber Assets (PCA) – Applies to each Protected Cyber Asset associated
with a referenced high impact BES Cyber System or medium impact BES Cyber
System.

C. Compliance
1. Compliance Monitoring Process:
1.1. Compliance Enforcement Authority:
As defined in the NERC Rules of Procedure, “Compliance Enforcement Authority” (CEA) means
NERC or the Regional Entity in their respective roles of monitoring and enforcing compliance
with the NERC Reliability Standards.
1.2. Evidence Retention:
The following evidence retention periods identify the period of time an entity is required to
retain specific evidence to demonstrate compliance. For instances where the evidence
retention period specified below is shorter than the time since the last audit, the CEA may ask
an entity to provide other evidence to show that it was compliant for the full time period since
the last audit.
The Responsible Entity shall keep data or evidence to show compliance as identified below
unless directed by its CEA to retain specific evidence for a longer period of time as part of an
investigation:
 Each Responsible Entity shall retain evidence of each requirement in this standard for three
calendar years.
 If a Responsible Entity is found non-compliant, it shall keep information related to the non-
compliance until mitigation is complete and approved or for the time specified above,
whichever is longer.
 The CEA shall keep the last audit records and all requested and submitted subsequent audit
records.
1.3. Compliance Monitoring and Assessment Processes:
Compliance Audits
Self-Certifications
Spot Checking
Compliance Violation Investigations
Self-Reporting
Complaints

Section 4 – Scope of Applicability of the CIP Cyber Security Standards
Section “4. Applicability” of the standards provides important information for Responsible
Entities to determine the scope of the applicability of the CIP Cyber Security Requirements.
Section “4.1. Functional Entities” is a list of NERC functional entities to which the standard
applies. If the entity is registered as one or more of the functional entities listed in Section 4.1,
then the NERC CIP Cyber Security Standards apply. Note that there is a qualification in Section
4.1 that restricts the applicability in the case of Distribution Providers to only those that own
certain types of systems and equipment listed in 4.2.
Section “4.2. Facilities” defines the scope of the Facilities, systems, and equipment owned by
the Responsible Entity, as qualified in Section 4.1, that is subject to the requirements of the
standard. As specified in the exemption section 4.2.3.5, this standard does not apply to
Responsible Entities that do not have High Impact or Medium Impact BES Cyber Systems under
CIP-002-5.1’s categorization. In addition to the set of BES Facilities, Control Centers, and other
systems and equipment, the list includes the set of systems and equipment owned by
Distribution Providers. While the NERC Glossary term “Facilities” already includes the BES
characteristic, the additional use of the term BES here is meant to reinforce the scope of
applicability of these Facilities where it is used, especially in this applicability scoping section.
This in effect sets the scope of Facilities, systems, and equipment that is subject to the
standards.
Requirement R1:
Requirement R1 exists to reduce the attack surface of Cyber Assets by requiring entities to
disable known unnecessary ports. The SDT intends for the entity to know what network
accessible (“listening”) ports and associated services are accessible on their assets and systems,
whether they are needed for that Cyber Asset’s function, and disable or restrict access to all
other ports.
1.1. This requirement is most often accomplished by disabling the corresponding service or
program that is listening on the port or configuration settings within the Cyber Asset. It can
also be accomplished through using host-based firewalls, TCP_Wrappers, or other means on
the Cyber Asset to restrict access. Note that the requirement is applicable at the Cyber Asset
level. The Cyber Assets are those which comprise the applicable BES Cyber Systems and their
associated Cyber Assets. This control is another layer in the defense against network-based
attacks, therefore the SDT intends that the control be on the device itself, or positioned inline
in a non-bypassable manner. Blocking ports at the ESP border does not substitute for this
device level requirement. If a device has no provision for disabling or restricting logical ports
on the device (example - purpose built devices that run from firmware with no port
configuration available) then those ports that are open are deemed ‘needed.’
Page 40 of 51
Guidelines and Technical Basis
1.2. Examples of physical I/O ports include network, serial and USB ports external to the
device casing. BES Cyber Systems should exist within a Physical Security Perimeter in which
case the physical I/O ports have protection from unauthorized access, but it may still be
possible for accidental use such as connecting a modem, connecting a network cable that
bridges networks, or inserting a USB drive. Ports used for ‘console commands’ primarily means
serial ports on Cyber Assets that provide an administrative interface.
The protection of these ports can be accomplished in several ways including, but not limited to:
 Disabling all unneeded physical ports within the Cyber Asset’s configuration
 Prominent signage, tamper tape, or other means of conveying that the ports
should not be used without proper authorization
 Physical port obstruction through removable locks
The network ports included in the scope of this requirement part are not limited to those on
the BES Cyber System itself. The scope of physical network ports includes those ports that may
exist on nonprogrammable devices such as unmanaged switches, hubs, or patch panels.
This is a ‘defense in depth’ type control and it is acknowledged that there are other layers of
control (the PSP for one) that prevent unauthorized personnel from gaining physical access to
these ports. Even with physical access, it has been pointed out there are other ways to
circumvent the control. This control, with its inclusion of means such as signage, is not meant
to be a preventative control against intruders. Signage is indeed a directive control, not a
preventative one. However, with a defense-in-depth posture, different layers and types of
controls are required throughout the standard with this providing another layer for depth in
Control Center environments. Once physical access has been achieved through the other
preventative and detective measures by authorized personnel, a directive control that outlines
proper behavior as a last line of defense is appropriate in these highest risk areas. In essence,
signage would be used to remind authorized users to “think before you plug anything into one
of these systems” which is the intent. This control is not designed primarily for intruders, but
for example the authorized employee who intends to plug his possibly infected smartphone
into an operator console USB port to charge the battery.
The Applicable Systems column was updated on CIP-007-6 Requirement 1, Part 1.2 to include
“Nonprogrammable communication components located inside both a PSP and an ESP.” This
should be interpreted to apply to only those nonprogrammable communication components
that are inside both an ESP and a PSP in combination, not those components that are in only
one perimeter as can be illustrated in the following diagram:

Requirement R2:
The SDT’s intent of Requirement R2 is to require entities to know, track, and mitigate the
known software vulnerabilities associated with their BES Cyber Assets. It is not strictly an
“install every security patch” requirement; the main intention is to “be aware of in a timely
manner and manage all known vulnerabilities” requirement.
Patch management is required for BES Cyber Systems that are accessible remotely as well as
standalone systems. Standalone systems are vulnerable to intentional or unintentional
introduction of malicious code. A sound defense-in-depth security strategy employs additional
measures such as physical security, malware prevention software, and software patch
management to reduce the introduction of malicious code or the exploit of known
vulnerabilities.
One or multiple processes could be utilized. An overall assessment process may exist in a top
tier document with lower tier documents establishing the more detailed process followed for
individual systems. Lower tier documents could be used to cover BES Cyber System nuances
that may occur at the system level.
2.1. The Responsible Entity is to have a patch management program that covers tracking,
evaluating, and installing cyber security patches. The requirement applies to patches only,
which are fixes released to handle a specific vulnerability in a hardware or software product.
The requirement covers only patches that involve cyber security fixes and does not cover
patches that are purely functionality related with no cyber security impact. Tracking involves
processes for notification of the availability of new cyber security patches for the Cyber Assets.
Documenting the patch source in the tracking portion of the process is required to determine
when the assessment timeframe clock starts. This requirement handles the situation where
security patches can come from an original source (such as an operating system vendor), but
must be approved or certified by another source (such as a control system vendor) before they
Page 42 of 51
Guidelines and Technical Basis
can be assessed and applied in order to not jeopardize the availability or integrity of the control
system. The source can take many forms. The National Vulnerability Database, Operating
System vendors, or Control System vendors could all be sources to monitor for release of
security related patches, hotfixes, and/or updates. A patch source is not required for Cyber
Assets that have no updateable software or firmware (there is no user accessible way to update
the internal software or firmware executing on the Cyber Asset), or those Cyber Assets that
have no existing source of patches such as vendors that no longer exist. The identification of
these sources is intended to be performed once unless software is changed or added to the
Cyber Asset’s baseline.
2.2. Responsible Entities are to perform an assessment of security related patches within 35
days of release from their monitored source. An assessment should consist of determination of
the applicability of each patch to the entity’s specific environment and systems. Applicability
determination is based primarily on whether the patch applies to a specific software or
hardware component that the entity does have installed in an applicable Cyber Asset. A patch
that applies to a service or component that is not installed in the entity’s environment is not
applicable. If the patch is determined to be non-applicable, that is documented with the
reasons why and the entity is compliant. If the patch is applicable, the assessment can include
a determination of the risk involved, how the vulnerability can be remediated, the urgency and
timeframe of the remediation, and the steps the entity has previously taken or will take.
Considerable care must be taken in applying security related patches, hotfixes, and/or updates
or applying compensating measures to BES Cyber System or BES Cyber Assets that are no longer
supported by vendors. It is possible security patches, hotfixes, and updates may reduce the
reliability of the system, and entities should take this into account when determining the type
of mitigation to apply. The Responsible Entities can use the information provided in the
Department of Homeland Security “Quarterly Report on Cyber Vulnerabilities of Potential Risk
to Control Systems” as a source. The DHS document “Recommended Practice for Patch
Management of Control Systems” provides guidance on an evaluative process. It uses severity
levels determined using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 2. Determination
that a security related patch, hotfix, and/or update poses too great a risk to install on a system
or is not applicable due to the system configuration should not require a TFE.
When documenting the remediation plan measures it may not be necessary to document them
on a one to one basis. The remediation plan measures may be cumulative. A measure to
address a software vulnerability may involve disabling a particular service. That same service
may be exploited through other software vulnerabilities. Therefore disabling the single service
has addressed multiple patched vulnerabilities.
2.3. The requirement handles the situations where it is more of a reliability risk to patch a
running system than the vulnerability presents. In all cases, the entity either installs the patch
or documents (either through the creation of a new or update of an existing mitigation plan)
what they are going to do to mitigate the vulnerability and when they are going to do so. There
are times when it is in the best interest of reliability to not install a patch, and the entity can
document what they have done to mitigate the vulnerability. For those security related
patches that are determined to be applicable, the Responsible Entity must within 35 days either
install the patch, create a dated mitigation plan which will outline the actions to be taken or
Page 43 of 51
Guidelines and Technical Basis
those that have already been taken by the Responsible Entity to mitigate the vulnerabilities
addressed by the security patch, or revise an existing mitigation plan. Timeframes do not have
to be designated as a particular calendar day but can have event designations such as “at next
scheduled outage of at least two days duration.” “Mitigation plans” in the standard refers to
internal documents and are not to be confused with plans that are submitted to Regional
Entities in response to violations.
2.4. The entity has been notified of, has assessed, and has developed a plan to remediate
the known risk and that plan must be implemented. Remediation plans that only include steps
that have been previously taken are considered implemented upon completion of the
documentation. Remediation plans that have steps to be taken to remediate the vulnerability
must be implemented by the timeframe the entity documented in their plan. There is no
maximum timeframe in this requirement as patching and other system changes carries its own
risk to the availability and integrity of the systems and may require waiting until a planned
outage. In periods of high demand or threatening weather, changes to systems may be
curtailed or denied due to the risk to reliability.
Requirement R3:
3.1. Due to the wide range of equipment comprising the BES Cyber Systems and the wide
variety of vulnerability and capability of that equipment to malware as well as the constantly
evolving threat and resultant tools and controls, it is not practical within the standard to
prescribe how malware is to be addressed on each Cyber Asset. Rather, the Responsible Entity
determines on a BES Cyber System basis which Cyber Assets have susceptibility to malware
intrusions and documents their plans and processes for addressing those risks and provides
evidence that they follow those plans and processes. There are numerous options available
including traditional antivirus solutions for common operating systems, white-listing solutions,
network isolation techniques, Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDS/IPS) solutions, etc. If an
entity has numerous BES Cyber Systems or Cyber Assets that are of identical architecture, they
may provide one process that describes how all the like Cyber Assets are covered. If a specific
Cyber Asset has no updateable software and its executing code cannot be altered, then that
Cyber Asset is considered to have its own internal method of deterring malicious code.
3.2. When malicious code is detected on a Cyber Asset within the applicability of this
requirement, the threat posed by that code must be mitigated. In situations where traditional
antivirus products are used, they may be configured to automatically remove or quarantine the
malicious code. In white-listing situations, the white-listing tool itself can mitigate the threat as
it will not allow the code to execute, however steps should still be taken to remove the
malicious code from the Cyber Asset. In some instances, it may be in the best interest of
reliability to not immediately remove or quarantine the malicious code, such as when
availability of the system may be jeopardized by removal while operating and a rebuild of the
system needs to be scheduled. In that case, monitoring may be increased and steps taken to
insure the malicious code cannot communicate with other systems. In some instances the
entity may be working with law enforcement or other governmental entities to closely monitor
the code and track the perpetrator(s). For these reasons, there is no maximum timeframe or
Page 44 of 51
Guidelines and Technical Basis
method prescribed for the removal of the malicious code, but the requirement is to mitigate
the threat posed by the now identified malicious code.
Entities should also have awareness of malware protection requirements for Transient Cyber
Assets and Removable Media (“transient devices”) in CIP-010-2. The protections required here
in CIP-007-6, Requirement R3 complement, but do not meet, the additional obligations for
transient devices.
3.3. In instances where malware detection technologies depend on signatures or patterns of
known attacks, the effectiveness of these tools against evolving threats is tied to the ability to
keep these signatures and patterns updated in a timely manner. The entity is to have a
documented process that includes the testing and installation of signature or pattern updates.
In a BES Cyber System, there may be some Cyber Assets that would benefit from the more
timely installation of the updates where availability of that Cyber Asset would not jeopardize
the availability of the BES Cyber System’s ability to perform its function. For example, some
HMI workstations where portable media is utilized may benefit from having the very latest
updates at all times with minimal testing. Other Cyber Assets should have any updates
thoroughly tested before implementation where the result of a ‘false positive’ could harm the
availability of the BES Cyber System. The testing should not negatively impact the reliability of
the BES. The testing should be focused on the update itself and if it will have an adverse impact
on the BES Cyber System. Testing in no way implies that the entity is testing to ensure that
malware is indeed detected by introducing malware into the environment. It is strictly focused
on ensuring that the update does not negatively impact the BES Cyber System before those
updates are placed into production.
Requirement R4:
Refer to NIST 800-92 and 800-137 for additional guidance in security event monitoring.
4.1. In a complex computing environment and faced with dynamic threats and
vulnerabilities, it is not practical within the standard to enumerate all security-related events
necessary to support the activities for alerting and incident response. Rather, the Responsible
Entity determines which computer generated events are necessary to log, provide alerts and
monitor for their particular BES Cyber System environment.
Specific security events already required in Version 4 of the CIP Standards carry forward in this
version. This includes access attempts at the Electronic Access Points, if any have been
identified for a BES Cyber Systems. Examples of access attempts include: (i) blocked network
access attempts, (ii) successful and unsuccessful remote user access attempts, (iii) blocked
network access attempts from a remote VPN, and (iv) successful network access attempts or
network flow information.
User access and activity events include those events generated by Cyber Assets within the
Electronic Security Perimeter that have access control capability. These types of events include:
(i) successful and unsuccessful authentication, (ii) account management, (iii) object access, and
(iv) processes started and stopped.
Page 45 of 51
Guidelines and Technical Basis
It is not the intent of the SDT that if a device cannot log a particular event that a TFE must be
generated. The SDT’s intent is that if any of the items in the bulleted list (for example, user
logouts) can be logged by the device then the entity must log that item. If the device does not
have the capability of logging that event, the entity remains compliant.
4.2. Real-time alerting allows the cyber system to automatically communicate events of
significance to designated responders. This involves configuration of a communication
mechanism and log analysis rules. Alerts can be configured in the form of an email, text
message, or system display and alarming. The log analysis rules can exist as part of the
operating system, specific application or a centralized security event monitoring system. On
one end, a real-time alert could consist of a set point on an RTU for a login failure, and on the
other end, a security event monitoring system could provide multiple alerting communications
options triggered on any number of complex log correlation rules.
The events triggering a real-time alert may change from day to day as system administrators
and incident responders better understand the types of events that might be indications of a
cyber-security incident. Configuration of alerts also must balance the need for responders to
know an event occurred with the potential inundation of insignificant alerts. The following list
includes examples of events a Responsible Entity should consider in configuring real-time alerts:
 Detected known or potential malware or malicious activity
 Failure of security event logging mechanisms
 Login failures for critical accounts
 Interactive login of system accounts
 Enabling of accounts
 Newly provisioned accounts
 System administration or change tasks by an unauthorized user
 Authentication attempts on certain accounts during non-business hours
 Unauthorized configuration changes
 Insertion of Removable Media in violation of a policy
4.3 Logs that are created under Part 4.1 are to be retained on the applicable Cyber Assets or
BES Cyber Systems for at least 90 days. This is different than the evidence retention period
called for in the CIP standards used to prove historical compliance. For such audit purposes,
the entity should maintain evidence that shows that 90 days were kept historically. One
example would be records of disposition of event logs beyond 90 days up to the evidence
retention period.
4.4. Reviewing logs at least every 15 days (approximately every two weeks) can consist of
analyzing a summarization or sampling of logged events. NIST SP800-92 provides a lot of
guidance in periodic log analysis. If a centralized security event monitoring system is used, log
analysis can be performed top-down starting with a review of trends from summary reports.
The log review can also be an extension of the exercise in identifying those events needing real-

time alerts by analyzing events that are not fully understood or could possibly inundate the
real-time alerting.
Requirement R5:
Account types referenced in this guidance typically include:
 Shared user account: An account used by multiple users for normal business functions
by employees or contractors. Usually on a device that does not support Individual User
Accounts.
 Individual user account: An account used by a single user.
 Administrative account: An account with elevated privileges for performing
administrative or other specialized functions. These can be individual or shared
accounts.
 System account: Accounts used to run services on a system (web, DNS, mail etc.). No
users have access to these accounts.
 Application account: A specific system account, with rights granted at the application
level often used for access into a Database.
 Guest account: An individual user account not typically used for normal business
functions by employees or contractors and not associated with a specific user. May or
may not be shared by multiple users.
 Remote access account: An individual user account only used for obtaining Interactive
Remote Access to the BES Cyber System.
 Generic account: A group account set up by the operating system or application to
perform specific operations. This differs from a shared user account in that individual
users do not receive authorization for access to this account type.
5.1 Reference the Requirement’s rationale.
5.2 Where possible, default and other generic accounts provided by a vendor should be
removed, renamed, or disabled prior to production use of the Cyber Asset or BES Cyber System.
If this is not possible, the passwords must be changed from the default provided by the vendor.
Default and other generic accounts remaining enabled must be documented. For common
configurations, this documentation can be performed at a BES Cyber System or more general
level.
5.3 Entities may choose to identify individuals with access to shared accounts through the
access authorization and provisioning process, in which case the individual authorization
records suffice to meet this Requirement Part. Alternatively, entities may choose to maintain a
separate listing for shared accounts. Either form of evidence achieves the end result of
maintaining control of shared accounts.
5.4. Default passwords can be commonly published in vendor documentation that is readily
available to all customers using that type of equipment and possibly published online.

Guidelines and Technical Basis
The requirement option to have unique password addresses cases where the Cyber Asset
generates or has assigned pseudo-random default passwords at the time of production or
installation. In these cases, the default password does not have to change because the system
or manufacturer created it specific to the Cyber Asset.
5.5. Interactive user access does not include read-only information access in which the
configuration of the Cyber Asset cannot change (e.g. front panel displays, web-based reports,
etc.). For devices that cannot technically or for operational reasons perform authentication, an
entity may demonstrate all interactive user access paths, both remote and local, are configured
for authentication. Physical security suffices for local access configuration if the physical
security can record who is in the Physical Security Perimeter and at what time.
Technical or procedural enforcement of password parameters are required where passwords
are the only credential used to authenticate individuals. Technical enforcement of the password
parameters means a Cyber Asset verifies an individually selected password meets the required
parameters before allowing the account to authenticate with the selected password. Technical
enforcement should be used in most cases when the authenticating Cyber Asset supports
enforcing password parameters. Likewise, procedural enforcement means requiring the
password parameters through procedures. Individuals choosing the passwords have the
obligation of ensuring the password meets the required parameters.
Password complexity refers to the policy set by a Cyber Asset to require passwords to have one
or more of the following types of characters: (1) lowercase alphabetic, (2) uppercase
alphabetic, (3) numeric, and (4) non-alphanumeric or “special” characters (e.g. #, $, @, &), in
various combinations.
5.6 Technical or procedural enforcement of password change obligations are required
where passwords are the only credential used to authenticate individuals. Technical
enforcement of password change obligations means the Cyber Asset requires a password
change after a specified timeframe prior to allowing access. In this case, the password is not
required to change by the specified time as long as the Cyber Asset enforces the password
change after the next successful authentication of the account. Procedural enforcement means
manually changing passwords used for interactive user access after a specified timeframe.
5.7 Configuring an account lockout policy or alerting after a certain number of failed
authentication attempts serves to prevent unauthorized access through an online password
guessing attack. The threshold of failed authentication attempts should be set high enough to
avoid false-positives from authorized users failing to authenticate. It should also be set low
enough to account for online password attacks occurring over an extended period of time. This
threshold may be tailored to the operating environment over time to avoid unnecessary
account lockouts.
Entities should take caution when configuring account lockout to avoid locking out accounts
necessary for the BES Cyber System to perform a BES reliability task. In such cases, entities
should configure authentication failure alerting.

Guidelines and Technical Basis
Rationale:
During development of this standard, text boxes were embedded within the standard to explain
the rationale for various parts of the standard. Upon BOT approval, the text from the rationale
text boxes was moved to this section.
Rationale for Requirement R1:
The requirement is intended to minimize the attack surface of BES Cyber Systems through
disabling or limiting access to unnecessary network accessible logical ports and services and
physical I/O ports.
In response to FERC Order No. 791, specifically FERC’s reference to NIST 800-53 rev. 3 security
control PE-4 in paragraph 149, Part 1.2 has been expanded to include PCAs and
nonprogrammable communications components. This increase in applicability expands the
scope of devices that receive the protection afforded by the defense-in-depth control included
in Requirement R1, Part 1.2.
The applicability is limited to those nonprogrammable communications components located
both inside a PSP and an ESP in order to allow for a scenario in which a Responsible Entity may
implement an extended ESP (with corresponding logical protections identified in CIP-006,
Requirement R1, Part 1.10). In this scenario, nonprogrammable components of the
communication network may exist out of the Responsible Entity’s control (i.e. as part of the
telecommunication carrier’s network).
Rationale for Requirement R2:
Security patch management is a proactive way of monitoring and addressing known security
vulnerabilities in software before those vulnerabilities can be exploited in a malicious manner
to gain control of or render a BES Cyber Asset or BES Cyber System inoperable.
Rationale for Requirement R3:
Malicious code prevention has the purpose of limiting and detecting the addition of malicious
code onto the applicable Cyber Assets of a BES Cyber System. Malicious code (viruses, worms,
botnets, targeted code such as Stuxnet, etc.) may compromise the availability or integrity of the
BES Cyber System.
Rationale for Requirement R4:
Security event monitoring has the purpose of detecting unauthorized access, reconnaissance
and other malicious activity on BES Cyber Systems, and comprises of the activities involved with
the collection, processing, alerting and retention of security-related computer logs. These logs
can provide both (1) the detection of an incident and (2) useful evidence in the investigation of
an incident. The retention of security-related logs is intended to support post-event data
analysis.
Audit processing failures are not penalized in this requirement. Instead, the requirement
specifies processes which must be in place to monitor for and notify personnel of audit
processing failures.

Guidelines and Technical Basis
Rationale for Requirement R5:
To help ensure that no authorized individual can gain electronic access to a BES Cyber System
until the individual has been authenticated, i.e., until the individual's logon credentials have
been validated. Requirement R5 also seeks to reduce the risk that static passwords, where
used as authenticators, may be compromised.
Requirement Part 5.1 ensures the BES Cyber System or Cyber Asset authenticates individuals
that can modify configuration information. This requirement addresses the configuration of
authentication. The authorization of individuals is addressed elsewhere in the CIP Cyber
Security Standards. Interactive user access does not include read-only information access in
which the configuration of the Cyber Asset cannot change (e.g. front panel displays, web-based
reports, etc.). For devices that cannot technically or for operational reasons perform
authentication, an entity may demonstrate all interactive user access paths, both remote and
local, are configured for authentication. Physical security suffices for local access configuration
if the physical security can record who is in the Physical Security Perimeter and at what time.
Requirement Part 5.2 addresses default and other generic account types. Identifying the use of
default or generic account types that could introduce vulnerabilities has the benefit ensuring
entities understand the possible risk these accounts pose to the BES Cyber System. The
Requirement Part avoids prescribing an action to address these accounts because the most
effective solution is situation specific, and in some cases, removing or disabling the account
could have reliability consequences.
Requirement Part 5.3 addresses identification of individuals with access to shared accounts.
This Requirement Part has the objective of mitigating the risk of unauthorized access through
shared accounts. This differs from other CIP Cyber Security Standards Requirements to
authorize access. An entity can authorize access and still not know who has access to a shared
account. Failure to identify individuals with access to shared accounts would make it difficult to
revoke access when it is no longer needed. The term “authorized” is used in the requirement to
make clear that individuals storing, losing, or inappropriately sharing a password is not a
violation of this requirement.
Requirement 5.4 addresses default passwords. Changing default passwords closes an easily
exploitable vulnerability in many systems and applications. Pseudo-randomly system generated
passwords are not considered default passwords.
For password-based user authentication, using strong passwords and changing them
periodically helps mitigate the risk of successful password cracking attacks and the risk of
accidental password disclosure to unauthorized individuals. In these requirements, the drafting
team considered multiple approaches to ensuring this requirement was both effective and
flexible enough to allow Responsible Entities to make good security decisions. One of the
approaches considered involved requiring minimum password entropy, but the calculation for
true information entropy is more highly complex and makes several assumptions in the
passwords users choose. Users can pick poor passwords well below the calculated minimum
entropy.
Page 50 of 51
Guidelines and Technical Basis
The drafting team also chose to not require technical feasibility exceptions for devices that
cannot meet the length and complexity requirements in password parameters. The objective
of this requirement is to apply a measurable password policy to deter password cracking
attempts, and replacing devices to achieve a specified password policy does not meet this
objective. At the same time, this requirement has been strengthened to require account
lockout or alerting for failed login attempts, which in many instances better meets the
requirement objective.
The requirement to change passwords exists to address password cracking attempts if an
encrypted password were somehow attained and also to refresh passwords which may have
been accidentally disclosed over time. The requirement permits the entity to specify the
periodicity of change to accomplish this objective. Specifically, the drafting team felt
determining the appropriate periodicity based on a number of factors is more effective than
specifying the period for every BES Cyber System in the Standard. In general, passwords for
user authentication should be changed at least annually. The periodicity may increase in some
cases. For example, application passwords that are long and pseudo-randomly generated could
have a very long periodicity. Also, passwords used only as a weak form of application
authentication, such as accessing the configuration of a relay may only need to be changed as
part of regularly scheduled maintenance.
The Cyber Asset should automatically enforce the password policy for individual user accounts.
However, for shared accounts in which no mechanism exists to enforce password policies, the
Responsible Entity can enforce the password policy procedurally and through internal
assessment and audit.
Requirement Part 5.7 assists in preventing online password attacks by limiting the number of
guesses an attacker can make. This requirement allows either limiting the number of failed
authentication attempts or alerting after a defined number of failed authentication attempts.
Entities should take caution in choosing to limit the number of failed authentication attempts
for all accounts because this would allow the possibility for a denial of service attack on the BES
Cyber System.
