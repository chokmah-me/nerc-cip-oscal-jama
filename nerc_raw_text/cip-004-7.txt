CIP-004-7 — Cyber Security – Personnel & Training
A. Introduction
1. Title: Cyber Security — Personnel & Training
2. Number: CIP-004-7
3. Purpose: To minimize the risk against compromise that could lead to misoperation or
instability in the Bulk Electric System (BES) from individuals accessing BES Cyber Systems by
requiring an appropriate level of personnel risk assessment, training, security awareness,
and access management in support of protecting BES Cyber Systems.
4. Applicability:
4.1. Functional Entities: For the purpose of the requirements contained herein, the
following list of functional entities will be collectively referred to as “Responsible

CIP-004-7 — Cyber Security – Personnel & Training
4.2.3.4. For Distribution Providers, the systems and equipment that are not
included in section 4.2.1 above.
4.2.3.5. Responsible Entities that identify that they have no BES Cyber
Systems categorized as high impact or medium impact according to
the CIP-002-5.1a identification and categorization processes.
5. Effective Dates: See Implementation Plan for CIP-004-7.
6. Background: Standard CIP-004 exists as part of a suite of CIP Standards related to cyber
security, which require the initial identification and categorization of BES Cyber Systems and
require a minimum level of organizational, operational, and procedural controls to mitigate
risk to BES Cyber Systems.
Most requirements open with, “Each Responsible Entity shall implement one or more
documented [processes, plan, etc.] that include the applicable items in [Table Reference].”
The referenced table requires the applicable items in the procedures for the common
subject matter of the requirements.
The term documented processes refers to a set of required instructions specific to the
Responsible Entity and to achieve a specific outcome. This term does not imply any
particular naming or approval structure beyond what is stated in the requirements. An
entity should include as much as it believes necessary in its documented processes, but it
must address the applicable requirements in the table.
The terms program and plan are sometimes used in place of documented processes where it
makes sense and is commonly understood. For example, documented processes describing
a response are typically referred to as plans (i.e., incident response plans and recovery
plans). Likewise, a security plan can describe an approach involving multiple procedures to
address a broad subject matter.
Similarly, the term program may refer to the organization’s overall implementation of its
policies, plans and procedures involving a subject matter. Examples in the standards
include the personnel risk assessment program and the personnel training program. The
full implementation of the CIP Cyber Security Standards could also be referred to as a
program. However, the terms program and plan do not imply any additional requirements
beyond what is stated in the standards.
Responsible Entities can implement common controls that meet requirements for multiple
high and medium impact BES Cyber Systems. For example, a single training program could
meet the requirements for training personnel across multiple BES Cyber Systems.
Measures for the initial requirement are simply the documented processes themselves.
Measures in the table rows provide examples of evidence to show documentation and
implementation of applicable items in the documented processes. These measures serve to
provide guidance to entities in acceptable records of compliance and should not be viewed
Page 3 of 31
CIP-004-7 — Cyber Security – Personnel & Training
as an all-inclusive list.
Throughout the standards, unless otherwise stated, bulleted items in the requirements and
measures are items that are linked with an “or,” and numbered items are items that are
linked with an “and.”
Many references in the Applicability section use a threshold of 300 MW for UFLS and UVLS.
This particular threshold of 300 MW for UVLS and UFLS was provided in Version 1 of the CIP
Cyber Security Standards. The threshold remains at 300 MW since it is specifically
addressing UVLS and UFLS, which are last ditch efforts to save the BES. A review of UFLS
tolerances defined within regional reliability standards for UFLS program requirements to
date indicates that the historical value of 300 MW represents an adequate and reasonable
threshold value for allowable UFLS operational tolerances.
“Applicable Systems” Columns in Tables:
Each table has an “Applicable Systems” column to further define the scope of systems to
which a specific requirement row applies. The CSO706 SDT adapted this concept from the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Risk Management Framework as a
way of applying requirements more appropriately based on impact and connectivity
characteristics. The following conventions are used in the “Applicable Systems” column as
described.
• High Impact BES Cyber Systems – Applies to BES Cyber Systems categorized as high
impact according to the CIP-002-5.1a identification and categorization processes.
• Medium Impact BES Cyber Systems – Applies to BES Cyber Systems categorized as
medium impact according to the CIP-002-5.1a identification and categorization
processes.
• Medium Impact BES Cyber Systems with External Routable Connectivity – Only applies
to medium impact BES Cyber Systems with External Routable Connectivity. This also
excludes Cyber Assets in the BES Cyber System that cannot be directly accessed through
External Routable Connectivity.
• Electronic Access Control or Monitoring Systems (EACMS) – Applies to each Electronic
Access Control or Monitoring System associated with a referenced high impact BES
Cyber System or medium impact BES Cyber System. Examples may include, but are not
limited to, firewalls, authentication servers, and log monitoring and alerting systems.
• Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) – Applies to each Physical Access Control
System associated with a referenced high impact BES Cyber System or medium impact
BES Cyber System with External Routable Connectivity.

C. Compliance
1. Compliance Monitoring Process:
1.1. Compliance Enforcement Authority: “Compliance Enforcement Authority” (CEA)
means NERC or the Regional Entity, or any entity as otherwise designated by an
Applicable Governmental Authority, in their respective roles of monitoring and/or
enforcing compliance with mandatory and enforceable Reliability Standards in
their respective jurisdictions.
1.2. Evidence Retention: The following evidence retention periods identify the period
of time an entity is required to retain specific evidence to demonstrate
compliance. For instances where the evidence retention period specified below is
shorter than the time since the last audit, the CEA may ask an entity to provide
other evidence to show that it was compliant for the full time period since the last
audit.
The applicable entity shall keep data or evidence to show compliance as identified
below unless directed by its CEA to retain specific evidence for a longer period of
time as part of an investigation:
• The applicable entity shall retain evidence of each requirement in this standard
for three calendar years.
• The applicable entity is found non-compliant, it shall keep information related
to the non-compliance until mitigation is complete and approved or for the
time specified above, whichever is longer.
• The CEA shall keep the last audit records and all requested and submitted
subsequent audit records.
1.3. Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement Program: As defined in the NERC Rules
of Procedure, “Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement Program” refers to the
identification of the processes that will be used to evaluate data or information for
the purpose of assessing performance or outcomes with the associated Reliability
Standard.
